# CS130-pipeline

In this assignment, I will be implementing a simplified 3D rendering pipeline (with flat shading). This will consist of several parts, introduced through a series of tests:

  1. Vertex and viewing transformations
  2. Rasterization and interpolation
  3. Clipping
  4. Using a z-buffer for hidden surfaces
